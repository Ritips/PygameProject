Row, row, row your boat  
Gently down the stream. 
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,  
Life is such a dream.  
 
Drive, drive, drive your car  
Gently down the street. 
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,  
Life is such a treat.  
 
Fly, fly, fly your plane  
Way up in the air.  
Merrily, merrily merrily merrily  
Life without a care.
